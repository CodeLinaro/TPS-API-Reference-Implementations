# RS-CDDL

Tooling to assist in the analysis and generation of code from
CDDL [RFC8610](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8610.txt).

Currently able to parse a wide range of CDDL documents and dump
their contents in the form of an Abstract Syntax Tree.

Code generation work will start shortly.

## What is provided

- Binaries
  - `astdump`, a command line program to dump the internal AST
    generated by parsing a provided CDDL input file. Note that
    this AST will be syntatically accurate, but may contain
    semantic errors which would be identified in later
    post-processing.
  - `cddlgen`, a command line program which will eventually be
    capable of generating code to serialize or deserialize
    CBOR that matches the CDDL description. Currently only an
    essentially non-functional skeleton.
- Library
  - A complete parser for [RFC8610](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8610.txt)
    CDDL, including generics.
  - An Abstract Syntax Tree type definition representing the
    output from parsing a CDDL file.
  - Support for representation of floats in the hexfloat format.
- Test cases
  - A number of CDDL files extracted from RCF8610 and others.
- Bugs and infelicities
  - Code generation is non-functional
  - Error reporting is essentially non-existant
